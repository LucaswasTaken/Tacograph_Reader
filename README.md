Analysis of Recorded Speeds from LRT Tachographs Using Image Processing" (DOI: 10.20906/CPS/CILAMCE2017-0152)

This project focus in the analysis of recorded speeds from LRT tachographs using image processing. Tachographs are mandatory equipment for commercial vehicles that carry loads and passengers. The main function of this device is to serve as data source for transportation companies and inspection agencies in case of infractions. However, manufacturers do not develop effective tools for practical and accurate interpretation of the measured speeds, making this task costly and subject to error. In order to attend this demand, this project proposes a methodology for the analysis of tachograph speed data in LRTs using image processing. The methodology presented has the advantage of being an automated software and having an adjustable precision. Calibration tests are performed for the strategy using travel data recorded by the tachographs of LRTs. These tests are also used as a base to improve the user interface of the software. The initial results show a good correspondence with the real values measured by the traffic engineers. In addition, the strategy shows a significant time reduction in the interpretation of the data of interest. The project is a joint initiative between members of CBTU and UFAL, being able to constantly evolve and create opportunities for new projects.
